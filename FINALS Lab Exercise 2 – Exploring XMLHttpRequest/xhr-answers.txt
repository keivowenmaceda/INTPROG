1. What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?
readyState shows the current state of the request (from 0 to 4). status shows the HTTP response code from the server (like 200 for success, 404 for not found).

2. How can you make the request asynchronous?
You make it asynchronous by setting the third parameter of xhr.open() to true, like this: xhr.open("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1", true);

3. Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?
Asynchronous communication is recommended because it prevents the webpage from freezing or becoming unresponsive while waiting for the serverâ€™s response, making the user experience smoother and faster.
